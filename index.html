      <h2>Tassie feels the heat</h2>
      <p>
        Tasmania is one of the most naturally diverse places in the world, teeming with native Australian and uniquely 
        Tasmanian wildlife and flora. It hosts some of the cleanest air in the world and is one of the most popular 
        tourist destinations in Australia for its beautiful national parks. Being a state dense with national parks and 
        bush, Tasmania is a state very susceptible to bushfires. This endangers many native species each year and can wipe
        out entire tourist destinations, which significantly impacts Tasmania with tourism increasingly making
        the backbone of Tasmania's ecomomy.

        <h2>Causes of bushfires</h2>
        <p>
          Most of Tasmanian bushfires can't be avoided, being ignited by <span class="natural">natural</span> 
          events such as lightning strikes. A significant portion of these fires, however, are avoidable and started 
          by human intervention, whether that be due to <span class="deliberate">deliberate arson</span> or
          <span class="accidental">accidental</span> fires from leaving campfires anattended or losing control of bonfires. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Counter-intuitively, one of the best ways of reducing bushfires is with <span class="planned">controlled burns</span>. 
          These planned burns are conducted to remove excess dry plant material, which could fuel potential bushfires. These 
          controlled burns are carefully monitored and are conducted at times where temperatures are low and fires are much 
          easier to control.
        </p>

        <p>
          Several more of these bushfires have <span class="undetermined">undetermined</span> origins. These could be any of 
          the above catagories, so there are likely many more fires being started due to human intervention.

        Several trends can be spotted by looking at the spread of Tasmania's bushfires over the years. 
        It is obvious from the chart below that the frequency of bushfires has been steadily increasing
        over the last 40 years. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Selecting the <span class="planned">planned burns</span> below, shows how
        Tasmania has become much more vigilent about controlling the dry fuel avaliable for burning. These 
        planned burns are staged in the winter months and end of the bushfire season when the fires are most
        easily controlled.

        <span class="deliberate">Deliberate arson</span> has always been sadly common in Tasmania, with many more
        small arson fires being recorded in recent years.

      <p>
        The largest fires are generally the <span class="natural">natural</span> fires caused by lightening strikes.
        As seen in the map below, these fires normally occur in sparsely-inhabbited west and south-west regions. These
        are started generally by lightneing strikes and can becomes devestatingly big due to the difficulty in accessing
        these fires deep in bushland to be able to extinguish them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Most <span class="accidental">accidental</span> fires can be seen on the east-coast, where many popular camping spots can
        be found. This indicates people leaving campfires unattended or letting bonfires go out of control.

        to explore the different bushfires recorded since 1980. You can investigate specific fires, the worst 
        bushfire seasons in the state's history or witness how planned control fires reduced bushfires in different areas.
